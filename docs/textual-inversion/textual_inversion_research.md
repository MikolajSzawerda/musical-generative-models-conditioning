COTI leverages a novel weighted scoring mechanism within a theoretically-guided loss framework, resulting in significant performance improvements over prior methods.

### New Contributions
COTI introduces a theoretically-guided loss objective with a weighted scoring mechanism and an active-learning paradigm, effectively reducing the need for additional datasets and human intervention while enhancing robustness and data efficiency in generative modeling.

## Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Textual Inversion

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15247v2
- **Published**: 2023-03-27 14:31:25
- **Authors**: Alberto Baldrati, Lorenzo Agnolucci, Marco Bertini, Alberto Del Bimbo
- **Categories**: , , 

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR), a novel approach that allows for image retrieval based on a relative caption and reference image without the need for labeled datasets. The authors present a new method called SEARLE and introduce a benchmarking dataset, CIRCO, to facilitate research in this area.

### New Contributions
The key contributions of this work include the introduction of the ZS-CIR task, the SEARLE method that utilizes a pseudo-word token mapping in CLIP embedding space, and the creation of the CIRCO dataset, which is the first to provide multiple ground truths for each query in the context of Composed Image Retrieval.
