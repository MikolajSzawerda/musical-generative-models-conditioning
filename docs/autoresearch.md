The paper introduces novel conditional expressions (CEs) that enable automatic detection of multiple blurs in images through blind deconvolution without the need for zero-sheet analysis. This method is illustrated using a model image.

### New Contributions
The introduction of conditional expressions that utilize derivatives of the zero-values of the z-transform allows for simultaneous detection of multiple blurs, streamlining the blind deconvolution process.

## Belief Conditioning Rules (BCRs)

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0607005v2
- **Published**: 2006-07-02 14:54:54
- **Authors**: Florentin Smarandache, Jean Dezert
- **Categories**: , 

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a novel family of Belief Conditioning Rules (BCRs) aimed at improving belief revision by adjusting belief assignments based on new conditioning constraints rather than fusing multiple sources of evidence.

### New Contributions
The paper presents a new methodology for belief revision that emphasizes the adaptation of existing belief assignments in light of updated truths about solution spaces, which differs from traditional approaches focused on evidence fusion.

## What does a conditional knowledge base entail?

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a logical framework for nonmonotonic reasoning through a new definition of rational consequence relations, highlighting their representation via ranked preferential and non-standard probabilistic models. The authors define the rational closure of a conditional knowledge base, proving its cumulative nature and computational tractability.

### New Contributions
The paper provides a new classification of nonmonotonic consequence relations as 'rational', distinct from previous 'preferential' relations, and establishes the concept of rational closure for conditional knowledge bases, which is both cumulative and computationally efficient.

## Probabilistic Default Reasoning with Conditional Constraints

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0003023v1
- **Published**: 2000-03-08 11:05:45
- **Authors**: Thomas Lukasiewicz
- **Categories**: , 

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases, generalizing existing entailment notions to improve understanding and application in this context.

### New Contributions
The study presents new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment specifically tailored for conditional constraints, demonstrating that these new concepts retain properties similar to their classical counterparts while serving as proper generalizations of both classical entailments and logical entailment.

## Conditional indifference and conditional preservation

- **Authors**: Gabriele Kern-Isberner
- **Categories**: , , 

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to the preservation of conditional beliefs, emphasizing their dynamic revision processes and axiomatizing a principle of conditional preservation within semi-quantitative contexts. The findings demonstrate how this principle aligns with and encompasses existing theories on conditional preservation.

### New Contributions
The paper presents a new framework for understanding conditionals as revision policies, introduces a specific principle of conditional preservation characterized by indifference in conditional structures, and establishes its relevance in both quantitative and qualitative belief revision contexts.
