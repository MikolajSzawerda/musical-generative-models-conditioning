### GPT Summary
This study investigates the potential of opportunistic CT scans to enhance the diagnosis of conditions like sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites by analyzing discrepancies between imaging findings and documentation. It highlights the underutilization of these diagnostic opportunities in clinical practice and suggests that deep learning methods can improve accuracy in clinical documentation.

### New Contributions
The paper introduces a comprehensive analysis of inpatient CT scans to reveal significant discrepancies between detected imaging phenotypes and their documentation in radiology reports and coding, indicating the need for improved diagnostic practices and the potential of deep learning to enhance clinical accuracy.
