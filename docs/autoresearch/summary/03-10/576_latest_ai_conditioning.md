## Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion for 3D Human  Reconstruction from Occluded Images

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18364v1
- **Published**: 2024-09-27T00:49:08Z
- **Authors**: Donghwan Kim, Tae-Kyun Kim
- **Categories**: , , 

### GPT Summary
The paper presents MHCDIFF, a novel pipeline for detailed 3D human shape reconstruction from a single RGB image, particularly under severe occlusion due to interactions. This method leverages point cloud diffusion conditioned on probabilistic distributions to enhance the reconstruction of occluded regions and correct misaligned parametric models.

### New Contributions
MHCDIFF introduces a multi-hypotheses approach that aggregates local features from multiple SMPL meshes, enabling effective handling of occlusion and misalignment, outperforming existing methods in synthetic and real-world scenarios.
