### GPT Summary
This paper identifies issues with default logics, particularly the 'lottery paradox' and a similar problem with default 'proof by cases', highlighting the necessity of specifying how 'typical' individuals are selected in reasoning processes. It also proposes a probabilistic account of defaults that resolves the 'multiple extension problem' associated with conjunctive and disjunctive knowledge.

### New Contributions
The paper reveals a new parallel between default logics and Simpson's paradox, and it introduces a probabilistic framework that alleviates the challenges presented by default reasoning and the selection of typical individuals.
