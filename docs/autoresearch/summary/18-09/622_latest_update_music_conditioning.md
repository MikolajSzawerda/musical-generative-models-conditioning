## Accompaniment Prompt Adherence: A measure for evaluating music  accompaniment systems

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00775v3
- **Published**: 2024-03-31T19:12:52Z
- **Authors**: Maarten Grachten, Javier Nistal
- **Categories**: , 

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a novel metric called Accompaniment Prompt Adherence (APA) for evaluating the alignment of musical generative systems with conditional audio prompts, validated through experiments and human listening tests.

### New Contributions
The paper presents the APA metric, which correlates well with human evaluations and can discriminate between varying levels of adherence in generated music. Additionally, it provides a Python implementation of the metric utilizing the CLAP embedding model, enhancing evaluation tools for music accompaniment generation.

### GPT Summary
This paper presents SynthSOD, a novel multitrack dataset designed for music source separation, focusing on orchestral recordings and addressing the lack of clean, diverse datasets in this area. The authors evaluate the performance of a popular music separation model trained on SynthSOD against the established EnsembleSet, demonstrating its effectiveness under various conditions.

### New Contributions
The introduction of the SynthSOD dataset, which utilizes simulation techniques to create a realistic and heterogeneous training set for orchestral music source separation, represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of extracting similar-sounding sources from complex audio recordings.
