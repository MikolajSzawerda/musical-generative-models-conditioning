### GPT Summary
This paper introduces Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer designed to improve the analysis of brain networks derived from fMRI data, particularly in identifying neurological disorders. It addresses challenges such as distribution shifts and node identity neglect, leading to significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods.

### New Contributions
Contrasformer leverages a two-stream attention mechanism to create a contrast graph that incorporates prior knowledge, addresses distribution shifts across sub-populations, and highlights node identities. It also employs three auxiliary losses to ensure group consistency, resulting in enhanced interpretability and accuracy in neurological disorder identification.

## Temporal Many-valued Conditional Logics: a Preliminary Report

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09069v1
- **Published**: 2024-09-06T16:23:31Z
- **Authors**: Mario Alviano, Laura Giordano, Daniele Theseider Dupr√©
- **Categories**: , , , 

### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a many-valued temporal conditional logic that integrates typicality with Linear Time Temporal Logic (LTL), enabling the formal representation of dynamic systems through strict and defeasible temporal properties, with a specific application to gradual argumentation.

### New Contributions
The paper presents a new formalism that combines many-valued logic with temporal operators to model dynamic systems, along with an instantiation for gradual argumentation, enhancing the expressiveness and applicability of conditional logic in temporal contexts.
