### GPT Summary
This paper introduces a Speaker-Conditional Chain Model aimed at improving speech separation in complex recordings by inferring speaker identities and using them as conditions for extracting speech sources. The model demonstrates enhanced adaptability for multi-round long recordings while achieving comparable results to existing methods on standard benchmarks.

### New Contributions
The novel contributions include the development of a Speaker-Conditional Chain Model that integrates speaker identity inference with speech source extraction, specifically enhancing performance in scenarios with multiple overlapping speakers and long recordings.
