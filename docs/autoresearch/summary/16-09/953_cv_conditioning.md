### GPT Summary
This paper presents a novel convolutional neural network, CRF-RNN, which integrates Conditional Random Fields with CNNs to enhance pixel-level labeling in semantic segmentation tasks. The proposed method allows for end-to-end training of the network, improving the delineation of visual objects without the need for offline post-processing.

### New Contributions
The CRF-RNN model introduces a new approach to combine CNNs with CRFs for semantic segmentation, allowing for mean-field approximate inference to be formulated as Recurrent Neural Networks and facilitating complete end-to-end training.
