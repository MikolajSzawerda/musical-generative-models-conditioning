### GPT Summary
This paper introduces Multi-Class Textual Inversion (MC-TI), a novel method that enhances the capabilities of Text-to-Image models for semantic-agnostic classification while preserving their generative abilities, using only a few samples per category.

### New Contributions
The paper presents the MC-TI technique that incorporates a discriminative regularization term to improve the performance of tokens learned through single-concept textual inversion, resulting in better outcomes for both classification and generation across multiple datasets.
