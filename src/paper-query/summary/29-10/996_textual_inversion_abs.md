## FreeStyle: Free Lunch for Text-guided Style Transfer using Diffusion  Models

- **ID**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15636v3
- **Published**: 2024-01-28T12:00:31Z
- **Authors**: Feihong He, Gang Li, Fuhui Sun, Mengyuan Zhang, Lingyu Si, Xiaoyan Wang, Li Shen
- **Categories**: , 

### GPT Summary
This paper presents FreeStyle, a novel style transfer method utilizing a pre-trained large diffusion model that allows for style transfer using only text descriptions, eliminating the need for style images and iterative optimization processes.

### New Contributions
FreeStyle introduces a dual-stream encoder and single-stream decoder architecture that achieves content and style decoupling, resulting in a significant reduction in computational requirements while maintaining high-quality synthesis and fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### GPT Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to generating realistic human motion from natural language by combining latent diffusion with a realignment mechanism to create a semantically structured motion space. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in motion synthesis and textual motion inversion, achieving enhanced realism and text-to-motion alignment compared to existing techniques.

### New Contributions
The paper introduces a new framework that integrates latent diffusion with a realignment mechanism, enabling the creation of a semantically structured motion space, and introduces the task of textual motion inversion for capturing novel motion concepts from limited examples.
